## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


```{r}
# Setting seed for reproducibility
set.seed(42)

# Number of days
days <- 100

# Simulate reading pages for each undergraduate, assuming independence
matt <- rnorm(days, mean=30, sd=10)
ash <- rnorm(days, mean=50, sd=15)
jacki <- rnorm(days, mean=20, sd=5)
rol <- rnorm(days, mean=45, sd=10)
mike <- rnorm(days, mean=40, sd=20)

# Ensuring no negative page counts
matt <- ifelse(matt < 0, 0, matt)
ash <- ifelse(ash < 0, 0, ash)
jacki <- ifelse(jacki < 0, 0, jacki)
rol <- ifelse(rol < 0, 0, rol)
mike <- ifelse(mike < 0, 0, mike)

# Creating a data frame
data <- data.frame(Day=1:days, Matt=matt, Ash=ash, Jacki=jacki, Rol=rol, Mike=mike)

# Performing five tests based on the simulated data

# 1. Test for normality for Matt's reading pattern
shapiro.test(data$Matt)

# 2. Test for normality for Ash's reading pattern
shapiro.test(data$Ash)

# 3. Correlation test between Matt and Ash (expecting low correlation due to independence)
cor.test(data$Matt, data$Ash)

# 4. Variance analysis - ANOVA to compare means across all undergraduates
anova(lm(cbind(Matt, Ash, Jacki, Rol, Mike) ~ Day, data=data))

# 5. Pairwise comparison of mean pages read per day between all undergraduates using Tukey's HSD test

install.packages("reshape2")
library(reshape2)
data_long <- melt(data, id.vars = "Day", variable.name = "Undergraduate", value.name = "Pages")

# ANOVA to compare means across all undergraduates
model <- aov(Pages ~ Undergraduate, data=data_long)
summary(model)

# Tukey's HSD test for pairwise comparison between all undergraduates
TukeyHSD(model)
